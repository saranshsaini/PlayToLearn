# Learn to Read Sheet Music

Ever wanted to look at squiggles on paper and somehow know whick key to press?

Maybe you've wanted to learn how to read multiple squiggles in quick succession, in turn allowing you to press multiple keys in quick succession, which ultimately lead to pleasant noises being produced by the instrument upon which those keys are affixed?

Now you can! It's just like learning to type on a keyboard without looking. Except this time you'll hear more than just clickity-clacks whilst you learn.

## To Add at One Point

There's a whole lot that can be added to this.

1. A virtual keyboard in case you don't have a MIDI capable one.
2. Stopwatch to measure speed along with accuracy.
3. A bunch of other stuff.
